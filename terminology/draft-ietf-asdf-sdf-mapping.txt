             Semantic Definition Format (SDF): Supplements
                   draft-ietf-asdf-sdf-mapping-latest

Abstract

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   that describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for
   interaction over a network.  It was created as a common language for
   use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization
   (OneDM) models.  Tools convert this format to database formats and
   other serializations as needed.

   An SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional
   information that is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or
   application.  SDF Supplements provide a mechanism to represent this
   augmentation.

Internet-Draft               SDF Supplements               February 2026


1.  Introduction

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   that describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for
   interaction over a network.  It was created as a common language for
   use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization
   (OneDM) models.  Tools convert this format to database formats and
   other serializations as needed.

   An SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional
   information that is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or
   application.  SDF Supplements provide a mechanism to represent this
   augmentation.


   // In this revision, we have renamed the map quality to amend since
   // the underlying data structure changed from an object to an array.
   // For this reason, we also change the term "Mapping File" to
   // "Supplement" to also reflect the fact that the file does not
   // actually contain a _map_ for describing the augmentation anymore.

1.1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The definitions of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf] apply.

   Supplement:  An SDF document that provides augmentation information
      for one or more SDF models.  This information is contained in an
      array of JSON objects, in which each key-value pair (or
      _amendment_) details the patch target and the patch value,
      respectively.

   Ammendment:  A patch contained within a Supplement that is supposed
      to be applied to the target SDF model via the JSON merge-patch
      algorithm [RFC7396].

   Augmentation:  The process of applying a Supplements amendments to a
      target SDF model.

   Augmented SDF Model:  The result of applying a Supplement's
      amendments to an SDF model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft               SDF Supplements               February 2026


2.  Overview

   An SDF Supplement provides augmentation information for one or more
   SDF models.  Its main contents are an array of patches that are
   applied using SDF name references (Section 4.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) as the respective target.

   When processing the Supplement together with one or more SDF models,
   the qualities from the array elements are added to the SDF model at
   the referenced name, as in a merge-patch operation [RFC7396].  Note
   that this is somewhat similar to the way sdfRef (Section 4.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) works, but in a Supplement the arrows point in
   the inverse direction (from the augmenter to the augmented).

   The order of the application of patches is that of the elements
   within the array (which is deterministic in contrast to the order of
   entries of an object).

2.1.  Example Model 1 (ecosystem: IPSO/OMA)

   An example for an SDF Supplement is given in Figure 1.  This
   Supplement is meant to attach to an SDF specification published by
   OneDM, and to add qualities relevant to the IPSO/OMA ecosystem.
   // Note that this example uses namespaces to identify elements of
   // the referenced specification(s), but has un-namespaced quality
   // names.  These two kinds of namespaces are unrelated in SDF, and a
   // more robust example may need to make use of Quality Name Prefixes
   // as defined in Section 2.3.3-3 of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf] (independent
   // of a potential feature to add namespace references to definitions
   // that are not intended to go into the default namespace — these are
   // SDF definition namespaces and not quality namespaces, which are
   // one meta-level higher).

2.2.  Example Model 2 (ecosystem: W3C WoT)

   This example shows a translation of a hypothetical W3C WoT Thing
   Model (as defined in Section 10 of [W3C.wot-thing-description11])
   into an SDF model plus a Supplement to catch Thing Model attributes
   that don't currently have SDF qualities defined (namely, titles and
   descriptions members used for internationalization).

   A second Supplement is more experimental in that it captures
   information that is actually instance-specific, in this case a forms
   member that binds the status property to an instance-specific CoAP
   resource.
   // Namespaces are all wrong in this example.

   The form really should be part of the class level; defining the
   entire form instead of just the link in the instance information is a
   symptom of not yet getting the class/instance boundary right.

3.  Formal Syntax of SDF Supplements

   An SDF Supplement has three optional components that are taken
   unchanged from SDF: The info block, the namespace declaration, and
   the default namespace.  The mandatory fourth component, the amend
   block, contains the list of amendments that are supposed to be
   applied to the target model, using an SDF name reference (usually a
   namespace and a JSON pointer) as the target to which a specified
   quality is applied to.

   Figure 6 describes the syntax of SDF Supplements using CDDL
   [RFC8610].

   start = sdf-mapping

   sdf-mapping = {
    ; info will be required in most process policies
    ? info: sdfinfo
    ? namespace: named<text>
    ? defaultNamespace: text
    amend: [ * amendments ]
   }

   amendments = {

   The JSON pointer that is used a the target can point to a JSON map in
   the SDF model to be augmented by adding or replacing map entries.  If
   necessary, the JSON map is created at the position indicated with the
   contents of the patch
   // (add examples).  Alternatively, the JSON pointer can point to an
   array (also possibly created if not existing before) and add an
   element to that array by using the "-" syntax introduced in the
   penultimate paragraph of Section 4 of [RFC6901].

4.  Augmentation Mechanism

   An SDF model and a compatible Supplement can be combined to create an
   _augmented_ SDF model.  (This process can be repeated with multiple
   Supplements by using the outcome of one augmentation as the input of
   the next one.)  As augmentation is not equal to instantiation,
   augmented SDF models are still abstract in nature, but are enriched
   with ecosystem-specific information.

      |  Note that it might be necessary to specify an augmentation
      |  mechanism for instance descriptions as well at a later point in
      |  time, once it has been decided what the instance description
      |  format might look like and whether such a format is needed.

   The augmentation mechanism is related to the resolution mechanism
   defined in Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf], but fundamentally
   different:

   Instead of a model file reaching out to other model files and
   integrating aspects into itself via sdfRef (_pull_ approach), the
   Supplement _pushes_ information into a new copy of a specific given
   SDF model.  The original SDF model does not need to know which
   Supplements it will be used with and can be used with several such
   Supplements independently of each other.

Internet-Draft               SDF Supplements               February 2026


   An augmented SDF model is produced from two inputs: An SDF model and
   a compatible Supplement, i.e. every JSON pointer key within elements
   of the amend array points to a location that already exists within
   the SDF model or has been created by a previous augmentation step.
   To perform the augmentation, a processor needs to create a copy of
   the original SDF model.  It then iterates over all entries within the
   Supplement's amend array elements.  During each iteration, the
   processor first obtains a reference to the target referred to by the
   JSON pointer in the respective key.  This reference is then used as
   the Target argument of the JSON Merge Patch algorithm [RFC7396] and
   the entry's value as the Patch argument; the target is replaced with
   the result of the merge-patch.

   Once the iteration has finished, the processor returns the resulting
   augmented SDF model.  Should the resolution of a JSON pointer or an
   application of the JSON Merge Patch algorithm fail, an error is
   thrown instead.

   An example for an augmented SDF model can be seen in Figure 7.  This
   is the result of applying the WoT-specific Supplement from Figure 4
   to the SDF model shown in Figure 3.  This augmented SDF model is one
   step away from being converted to a WoT Thing Model or Thing
   Description, which requires some information that cannot be provided
   in an SDF model that is limited to the vocabulary defined in the SDF
   base specification.

      |  Since the pair of an SDF model and a Supplement is equivalent
      |  in semantics to the augmented model created from the two, there
      |  is no fundamental difference between specifying aspects in the
      |  SDF model or leaving them in a Supplement.  Also, parts of an
      |  ecosystem-specific vocabulary may in fact be mappable to the
      |  SDF base vocabulary.  Therefore, developing the mapping between
      |  SDF and an ecosystem requires careful consideration which of
      |  the features should be available to other ecosystems and
      |  therefore should best be part of the common SDF model, and
      |  which are best handled in a Supplement specific to the
      |  ecosystem.

4.1.  Logging Augmentation

   Since an augmented model is not fundamentally different from any
   other SDF model, it may be necessary to trace the provenance of the
   information that flowed into it, e.g., in the info block.  For this
   purpose, a new quality called augmentationLog is introduced that
   contains an array of URIs pointing to the Supplements that have been
   used to augment the original SDF file (which can also be indicated
   via the originalSdfModel quality).  These additional qualities allow
   for reproducing the augmentation process.

   For logging while performing an augmentation, the processor has to
   perform the following steps:

   1.  If the info block is not present in the model that is being
       augmented, the processor creates it.

   2.  If the info block does not contain an augmentationLog quality,
       the processor performs the following steps:

       1.  If the originalSdfModel quality is not present in the info
           block, the processor adds it with a URI that can be used to
           access the SDF model that is currently being augmented as its
           value.

       2.  The processor creates the augmentationLog quality with an
           array containing URIs that can be used to access the current
           Supplement as its sole item.

   3.  Otherwise, if augmentationLog does not contain an array, stop and
       throw an error.

   4.  Otherwise, the processor adds a URI that can be used to access
       the current Supplement to the array of the augmentationLog
       quality.
