            Semantic Definition Format (SDF): Mapping files
                 draft-bormann-asdf-sdf-mapping-latest

Abstract

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   that describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for
   interaction over a network.  It was created as a common language for
   use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization
   (OneDM) models.  Tools convert this format to database formats and
   other serializations as needed.

   An SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional
   information that is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or
   application.  SDF mapping files provide a mechanism to represent this
   augmentation.

Internet-Draft                 SDF Mapping                     July 2025


1.  Introduction

   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
   that describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for
   interaction over a network.  It was created as a common language for
   use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization
   (OneDM) models.  Tools convert this format to database formats and
   other serializations as needed.

   An SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional
   information that is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or
   application.  SDF mapping files provide a mechanism to represent this
   augmentation.

1.1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The definitions of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf] apply.

   The term "byte" is used in its now-customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Overview

   An SDF mapping file provides augmentation information for one or more
   SDF models.  Its main contents is a map from SDF name references
   (Section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) to a set of qualities.

   When processing the mapping file together with one or more SDF
   models, these qualities are added to the SDF model at the referenced
   name, as in a merge-patch operation [RFC7396].  Note that this is
   somewhat similar to the way sdfRef (Section 4.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) works, but in a mapping file the arrows point in
   the inverse direction (from the augmenter to the augmented).

2.1.  Example Model 1 (ecosystem: IPSO/OMA)

   An example for an SDF mapping file is given in Figure 1.  This
   mapping file is meant to attach to an SDF specification published by
   OneDM, and to add qualities relevant to the IPSO/OMA ecosystem.
   // Note that this example uses namespaces to identify elements of
   // the referenced specification(s), but has un-namespaced quality
   // names.  These two kinds of namespaces are unrelated in SDF, and a
   // more robust example may need to make use of Quality Name Prefixes
   // as defined in Section 2.3.3-3 of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf] (independent
   // of a potential feature to add namespace references to definitions
   // that are not intended to go into the default namespace — these are
   // SDF definition namespaces and not quality namespaces, which are
   // one meta-level higher).

   *  Start of a mapping file for certain OneDM playground models:

   {
     "info": {
       "title": "IPSO ID mapping"
     },
     "namespace": {
       "onedm": "https://onedm.org/models"
     },
     "defaultNamespace": "onedm",
     "map": {
       "#/sdfObject/Digital_Input": {
         "id": 3200
       },
       "#/sdfObject/Digital_Input/sdfProperty/Digital_Input_State": {
         "id": 5500
       },
       "#/sdfObject/Digital_Input/sdfProperty/Digital_Input_Counter": {
         "id": 5501
       }
     }
   }

             Figure 1: A simple example of an SDF mapping file

2.2.  Example Model 2 (ecosystem: W3C WoT)

   This example shows a translation of a hypothetical W3C WoT Thing
   Model (as defined in Section 10 of [W3C.wot-thing-description11])
   into an SDF model plus a mapping file to catch Thing Model attributes
   that don't currently have SDF qualities defined.
   // The example probably would be more useful with, say, protocol
   // bindings.  This is left for a future version of this example, and/

   // or a future specification that specifically addresses how to map
   // Thing Models into SDF.  (There is also the separate requirement to
   // transform a Thing Description into the kind of information that
   // can be represented in SDF plus instance information, such as IP
   // addresses or specific node names.)  Finally, namespaces are all
   // wrong in this example.

3.  Formal Syntax of SDF mapping files

   An SDF mapping file has three optional components that are taken
   unchanged from SDF: The info block, the namespace declaration, and
   the default namespace.  The mandatory fourth component, the "map",
   contains the mappings from an SDF name reference (usually a namespace
   and a JSON pointer) to a nested map providing a set of qualities to
   be merged in at the site identified in the name reference.

   Figure 5 describes the syntax of SDF mapping files using CDDL
   [RFC8610].

   start = sdf-mapping

   sdf-mapping = {
    ; info will be required in most process policies
    ? info: sdfinfo
    ? namespace: named<text>
    ? defaultNamespace: text
    map: { * global-sdf-pointer => additionalqualities}
   }
